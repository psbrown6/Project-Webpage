          <h5> by <em>Kagie Finlay</em> on May 16, 2017 </h5> 
          <p>It’s hard to believe that you might not recognize your own dog, but there might be someone there to make you question yourself. That’s exactly what happened to Santoria Nesbit when she went to pick up her dog, Prince, from the Tampa Pet Resort and Spa. When she arrived to pick up Prince, she was given a dog she didn’t think was him. But despite her skepticism, the staff member of the Resort assured her that the dog was indeed Prince. “She really made me feel like I could possibly not know my dog, that’s weird to say but every pushback I had she had some sort of justification,” she told Fox 13.
          </p>

          Nesbit, however, said she was positive she was given the wrong dog as soon as she got in the car. She decided to take the dog home and return the next day looking for Prince. It turns out that Prince had gone home with another family – the family who owned the dog Nesbit went home with. Thankfully, the incident was short-lived and both dogs were returned to their original families. Tampa Pet Resort and Spa has apologized profusely for the mix-up and comped Prince’s stay.
